# Pokedex

This project came to be during my CF course.
It is a Pokedex which displays a list of pokemon.

The Pokemon data is fetched from a public API:
[Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

If you click on a Pokemon it will show you the details of it (height, weight, etc).
Depending on what screen size you are on, the information will be displayed in a modal or on the page itself.
